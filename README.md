# Blind-Assistance

A currency identification project designed for the assistance of blind individuals employs deep learning to enable independent identification of currency notes. Through a user-friendly interface, blind users can capture images of currency notes using a smartphone or dedicated device. The trained model predicts the currency denomination and provides auditory feedback, giving the identified currency.
